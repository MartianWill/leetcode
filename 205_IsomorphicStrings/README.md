# Isomorphic Strings

Given String s="egg", t="add", return boolean if they are Isomorphic. And one character should only be mapped to one character

## Approach

isomorphism, in modern algebra, a one-to-one correspondence (mapping) between two sets that preserves binary relationships between elements of the sets. This String problem is the same concept. it has to be one-on-one in the same direction.
And one character should only be mapped to one character
