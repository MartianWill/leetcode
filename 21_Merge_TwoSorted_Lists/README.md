# Merge Two Sorted Lists

Two sorted linked lists, list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4], merge into one sorted list.
output = [1,1,2,3,4,4]

## Approach

linked list.
temp node to hold merged list
temp->0
current->0
compare , current.next is whichever smaller, curretn move ot next

O(m+n) time complexity, depends on list size
O(1) space complexity, uses constant amoumt of extra space.
